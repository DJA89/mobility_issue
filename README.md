# README

This project is to help find an error when using the mobility gem, it's the minimum possible example I've found at the moment.

You can see the failing query in the task on [lib/tasks/bad_query.rake](lib/tasks/bad_query.rake), you can either run the task itself to see the result or just run the query in the rails console.
